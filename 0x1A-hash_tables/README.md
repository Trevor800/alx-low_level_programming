Hash tables
All solutions done and submitted correctly
If you want to test for collisions, here are some strings that collide using the djb2 algorithm:

hetairas collides with mentioner
heliotropes collides with neurospora
depravement collides with serafins
stylist collides with subgenera
joyful collides with synaphea
redescribed collides with urites
dram collides with vivency
